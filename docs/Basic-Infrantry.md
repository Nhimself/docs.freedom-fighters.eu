## Team Members

The primary unit we‟ll be focusing on in this section of the training will be the Special Forces team. Each team normally consists of 6 members, each with a different role.

1. The Team Lead (TL)
    The team lead leads the entire team, decides which formation to use and has an under barrel grenade launcher. He is also the most experienced member of the team.
2. The Automatic Rifleman
    The automatic rifleman carries the automatic rifle, which is basically a light machine gun. He has the most raw firepower and ammo in the team.
3. The Radio Operator
    The radio operator operates the long range radio and has a rangefinder. His primary role is to communicate with other teams and air support.
4. The AT Specialist
    The AT specialist carries an unguided rocket launcher with 2 missiles.
5. The Marksman
    The marksman carries the marksman rifle along with long range optics.
6. The Saboteur
    The saboteur primarily carries explosives. He can also deploy a variety of mines.
7. The Medic
    The medic carries a large amount of medical equipment to keep his team alive. He‟s usually also the mission maker.

This team can be divided into smaller 2-man **buddy teams**. There are 3 buddy teams, **red** , **blue** and **gold**. The team lead can divide his team members into these buddy teams however he likes. Here‟s an example of how a team lead will usually divide his team. The underlined units are the buddy team leaders.

**Red** : Team Lead + Medic
**Blue** : Radio Operator + Saboteur
**Gold** : Automatic Rifleman + Marksman

Buddy teams are primarily used in bounding overwatch (see Advanced Infantry) and for quickly splitting up the team.

## The Automatic Rifleman

Overall the automatic rifleman is a fairly simple role to fulfill. Because of the light machine gun‟s high rate of fire, large magazine and high recoil, the automatic rifleman will primarily be suppressing enemies at medium to long ranges. This gives him great synergy with the marksman. When put together on a hill with long sightlines they can be absolutely devastating.

However, his primary weapon is not suppressed. This means he has to fall back on his silenced pistol when conducting operations relying heavily on stealth. It‟s very important to only switch back to your primary, unsuppressed weapon when told to do so, or when it‟s obvious that your firepower is required.

Seeing as you will be doing a lot of medium/long range shooting as the automatic rifleman it‟s important to know how to maximize your accuracy. Going prone and resting your weapon is very important to accomplish this.

Weapon resting:
Weapon resting is most useful when crouching or standing. It will lower your recoil and weapon sway, which allows for longer bursts of fire, which in turn increases your suppressive capabilities. You can also rest your weapon while prone with your bipod.
Weapon resting is present in the vanilla game. The default key to deploy your weapon is C, but it‟s recommended you rebind this to ctrl + space.

## The Saboteur

The saboteur or explosive specialist is, as the name suggests, a role that brings a lot of explosives to the table. By default you will be carrying a single satchel charge, a demo charge and an M6 SLAM. However, depending on the mission the saboteur must be able to deploy a variety of other explosives, including AT mines, tripwire mines and more. We‟ll be going over each one in this section.

### Explosives charges

```
 M112 Demolition Block
The M112 Demolition Block is an explosive charge that can be set on a timer or triggered by a remote detonator. It is compatible with both the M26 and M57 remote detonator.
```

```
 M183 Demolition Charge Assembly
The M183 Demolition Charge Assembly is the big brother of the explosive charge. It fulfills the same role, but it has a larger explosive radius and it can destroy entire buildings. It is compatible with both the M26 and M57 remote detonator.
```

```
 M18A1 Claymore
The claymore is a timed or remote triggered anti- personnel charge. It releases deadly steel balls in a frontal direction with an effective kill radius of up to 50 metres. It is placed on the ground, not dug in. Make sure that when you place the claymore that it faces the correct way.
It is only compatible with the M57 remote detonator.
```

### How to place and detonate explosive charges

Open the ACE Self-interaction menu by holding CTRL + Left Windows Key. Select the “Explosives” menu and click “Place”. Select the explosive you want to place. Now, you can place the charge precisely in 3D. Move the mouse around to find the sweet spot, for example underneath a vehicle. You can hold CTRL and use the scroll wheel to rotate the explosive. Press the left mouse button to finalize the placement. After the animation finishes, you still have to select a method of detonation.

Walk up to the charge and hold the interaction key. Select the dot and then “Select a trigger”. Usually, you‟ll want to select M152 RAMS to detonate it at will from a distance. After the animation finishes, the charge is live. Take not of the explosive code in the bottom left. If you place multiple charges, you‟ll have to remember which charge belongs to which explosive code when setting them off.

Run a good distance away from the charge, 50- 100 m at least. If you set it on a timer, simply wait for the time to run out. If you attached a remote detonator, open the ACE self-interaction menu again, select explosives  detonate. Then select the M26 firing device and the correct explosive code. This will set off the charge.

### Mines

```
 M15 Anti-Tank Mine
The M15 Anti-Tank Mine mine is a very heavy mine that is designed to take out heavy tanks. It can only be triggered with a pressure plate. Note that this mine can only be triggered by APCs and tanks. Cars or other light vehicles won‟t trigger this mine.
```

```
 VS-50 Anti-Personnel Mine
The VS-50 Anti-Personnel Mine is a fairly lightweight mine that is highly effective against infantry. Note that this mine will also be triggered by vehicles. It will do decent damage against cars, but it won‟t kill the passengers.
```

```
 M26 Anti-Personnel Bounding Mine
The M26 Anti-Personnel Bounding Mine is similar to the VS- 50 , except that this mine will “jump up” when triggered, spraying fragmentation at waist height. This makes it highly effective in open areas against infantry. This mine can also be triggered by vehicles.
```

```
 PMR-3 Anti-Personnel Tripwire Mine
The PMR-3 Anti-personnel Tripwire Mine is the tripwire variant of the APERS mine.
Because of the tripwire, it can cover a larger area, which can make it useful to cover chokepoints.
```

```
 M6 SLAM Mine
The M6 SLAM mine is a lightweight anti-vehicle mine. It is effective against
light armoured vehicles. The SLAM has 3 modes. The first is the IR sensor (side attack). When placed in this mode, the SLAM will detect movement in front of it with an IR sensor. If it detects a vehicle, it will fire off a projectile at a max range of about 10 metres. This mode is less effective than the others, but it allows you to place the SLAM on the side of the road instead of in the middle.
The second mode is the magnetic influence sensor (bottom attack). When placed in this mode, the SLAM acts like a lighter variant of the anti-tank mine. This mode will also only trigger on vehicles. This mode will deal more damage. However, seeing as the SLAM isn‟t buried but rather placed on the ground, it is easier to spot. Finally, you can put it on a timer, much like the regular explosive charges.
```

#### Notes

```
 Never run forward after placing a mine! The mine will always be placed in front of you, so run backwards after placing it.
```

```
 You can defuse anything you‟ve placed as a saboteur. Approach the explosive carefully, especially if it‟s a mine. Use the self-interaction menu on the explosive. Click “defuse” and wait for the animation to finish. You can now pick up the explosive off the ground with the action menu. 
Note that some explosives can blow up in your face if you try to defuse them.
```

## The AT Specialist

### Introduction

The AT specialist is the SF team‟s main countermeasure to hostile armoured vehicles.

The primary anti-tank launcher you‟ll be using is the M 136 or AT 4. It fires rockets of an 84 mm caliber, with an effective range of around 400 meters against stationary targets. The primary ammunition you‟ll be using is the High Explosive Anti-Tank round, also known as the HEAT round. This makes the launcher effective against APCs and other lights vehicles, but rather ineffective against tanks. Alternatively, the launcher can be used to breach through walls from a distance.

#### Sighting

Once you‟ve determined the range to the target using the techniques described above, it‟s time to sight the launcher properly to actually hit the target. By default, the launcher is sighted-in at 100 meters. You can change the sighting by using the “Page Up” and “Page Down” keys by default. Once you‟ve done that, simply aim straight at the middle point of the target and fire using the correct procedure, more on this further down.

Many times, your target will not perfectly be at the distance that your launcher is sighted-in at. Instead, it‟ll be at 230 or 360 meters away from you. You‟ll either have to compensate for that by manually aiming above or below your target,
which is not always reliable. Alternatively, you can move further from the target or closer to the target so that the range lines up with the sighting on your launcher. Always make sure you ask your team lead for permission before you run off to do this!

#### Firing

Once you‟re ready to fire your rocket, there are a couple of things you have to do first. Your launcher will give off a blast of pressure and heat towards the back, which can hurt your teammates. Therefore, it‟s important to make sure there‟s no one behind you.

First off, you want to look over your shoulders using free look while calling out “Clear back blast”. Then, you wait until your team lead or someone else calls out “Back blast clear”. This gives you the go-ahead to fire off your rocket. Right before you do, however, call out “Rocket, rocket, rocket”. This is a last warning for anyone around you that you‟re about to fire off a rocket and that they should get away from you.

## Formations and Sectors

The SF team is able to form 3 basic formations. In each formation, every member is assigned a sector, based on where they are in the formation. When moving, you should use the free look option in ArmA 3 to check your sector every couple seconds. When the team halts, you turn towards your sector and cover it.

The four sectors are as follows: front, right, left, rear. These are relative to the direction of movement. Front will always be the last direction your team was moving in. Only two members have a set sector to cover; the team lead (front) and the medic (rear). Everyone else‟s sector will depend on where they are in the formation.

When the team moves, the lead will usually call out “moving” followed by the speed at which you are travelling (sprint, jog, combat pace, walking), weapons up or weapons down and possibly the stance (prone, crouch, stand up). It is important that you follow these orders as they will tell you exactly how to move. If the team lead omits any of these, it‟s a safe bet that that particular aspect hasn‟t changed since the last time you moved.

The team leads voice usually can‟t reach a full six man team. Therefore, you should repeat the orders called out on direct speech so the people in the back can also hear them.

### Column Formation

Use: when marching through safe areas or in urban areas with little room to maneuver. In this example the AR is second in the column.

### Wedge Formation

Use: in the open when enemy contact is likely. Note that the medic (nr. 4 ), can either be on the left or right side of this formation depending on the circumstances.

### Line Formation

Use: when assaulting enemy positions or cresting a hill, mostly used for the base of fire elements.

## Communications

Freedom Fighters makes use of the ACRE2 mod combined with TeamSpeak 3 to make communication in game both easier and more realistic.

Your TeamSpeak push to talk button allows you to communicate over direct speech in 3D directional audio with everyone that is close enough to you on the virtual battlefield. You can change how loud/far your character speaks by **holding tab and scrolling**. It goes from whispering to yelling. In a regular fireteam, you won‟t want to raise this too high, because of how close the teams usually work together. If you start yelling, you might interfere with the communications of nearby fireteams.

To use your selected radio, hold the **caps lock** key. Within the team you will primarily be using direct speech, but some circumstances may require you to use your radio. If you do use the radio, keep your messages short and clear.

By default you will have the AN-PRC/ 343. It has an effective range of 800 meters, assuming there‟s no terrain blocking the signal. You can open your radio with the **CTRL + ALT + CAPS LOCK** key combination. This will show you a physical representation of the radio, as shown on the next page. There are 2 buttons at the top of the radio.

```
 The first one ( 1 ) controls the channels. Left clicking will cycle through the next channels. Right clicking will cycle through previous channels. 
 The second one ( 2 ) controls the volume. Left clicking will raise the volume. Right clicking will lower the volume.
```

Finally, you can also set the radio to your right, left or both ears using **control + shift + right/left/up arrow key**. This is mostly useful when using multiple radios.

These key combinations are the most important ones. If you want to check and/or change these key bindings, you can do so by opening the controls menu and click “configure addons” at the bottom of the screen.

## Medical Emergencies

Freedom Fighters makes use of ACE 3‟s advanced medical system to simulate a semi-realistic medical system. This system can be quite complex. In this section we will try to outline the information a regular fireteam member needs to treat himself in case he gets wounded. If you'd like to know more, visit the ACE medical wiki.

When you get hit, you will get wounded in one or more parts of your body: the head, the torso and the four limbs. They wound you will receive is dependent on the source of the damage inflicted upon you. If you get shot, you might receive a velocity wound, whereas falling down might cause a contusion. There are eight different wound types with different characteristics (bleeding rate and pain). See **table G- 1** on the next page for a complete list. Not all wounds cause bleeding, but if they do, your screen will start flashing red.

Each wound comes in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The larger the wound, the faster it will bleed and the more bandages it will require.

In order to deal with these types of wounds, four different types of bandages exist. Each has a varying effectiveness against particular wounds and a different chance to reopen (see further down). Knowing which bandage is best against which wound is not a skill that is required for a fireteam member, because you only receive one type of bandage: the field dressing. Nonetheless, see **table G- 2** for a complete list of the bandages and their characteristics.

Another important part of the medical system is pain. Getting wounded doesn't just cause to bleed, it also causes pain. This is represented as a flashing white effect on your screen which can be very annoying. To deal with this, everyone is equipped with a syringe of **morphine**. This will instantly remove all of your pain.
The downside to using morphine is that it lowers your heart rate. If your heart rate goes down too much, it can cause you to go unconscious and die. This effect slowly wears off over the course of ~15 minutes. If you‟ve already used morphine recently, let the medic know, otherwise you risk dropping your heart rate dangerously low with a second shot of morphine.

To counteract these effects, every soldier is also equipped with **epinephrine**. Epinephrine will raise your heart rate and can be used to counteract the effects of morphine. We don't recommend using it right after a morphine, because then you'e just wasting it. Only use it if you really need to raise someon's heart rate very quickly.

Finally, everyone also carries a tourniquet. A tourniquet can be used on any limb to slow down bleeding in that part of the body. This can be very useful if you're bleeding heavily from your arm or leg and you can‟t stop the bleeding with your bandages. Don' leave it on for too long though, because it can cause severe pain after ~5 minutes.

So far w've discussed the equipment a fireteam member has. Now we're going to discuss what the medic has, so you know what he can and cannot do.

On top of everything a regular soldier has, the medic carries at least 10 of every bandage and 10 of morphine & epinephrine. Furthermore, he carries 5 blood bags to restore lost blood, 5 extra tourniquets, a surgical kit and a personal aid kit. A **surgical kit** is used to stich up bandaged wounds to prevent them from reopening. It does not restore any of your “hit points”. A **personal aid kit** (or PAK) on the other hand, can be used to fully heal a stable patient. It will restore the ability to walk if you‟re shot in the leg, and restore all of your hit points.

**What to do when you are wounded**

Now that we‟ve discussed all the available medical equipment, we‟re now going to go over what exactly to do when you‟re wounded.

First, it is obviously important to bandage yourself up. If you don‟t, you will start losing blood which can cause you to go unconscious and eventually die. You can bandage yourself with the self-interaction menu (ctrl + left windows by default). Hover over the affected body part (marked in red) and select “Field Dressing” to apply a bandage. Make sure to check again afterwards to make sure the wound is fully bandaged. In case you have a large, fast bleeding wound on one of your limbs, you can decide to tourniquet yourself as a temporary solution. Just be sure to take it off again within 5 minutes! The procedure for this is the exact same as a bandage, except the option is called “Tourniquet”.

Be smart when you decide to bandage yourself. Do it in a safe place, in hard cover or even behind smoke. If you decide to do it in the open instead, there‟s a good chance you‟ll get shot again before you can finish bandaging yourself.

The main problem for you now is that the wound you just bandaged can reopen and start bleeding again. Luckily, the medic possesses a surgical kit which allows him to stitch up your wounds so they won‟t reopen. This does not mean that you shouldn‟t bandage your wounds and just run to the medic in the middle of a firefight to ask to get bandaged and stitched. Deal with your current wounds as best you can and report to your fireteam lead that you‟ve been hit. The medic will either come to you when he can or you‟ll be told to go to the medic. We can't risk the medic dying because he‟s the only one who can use the personal aid kits.

You can also decide to apply morphine to yourself if the medic won‟t be available for a while and you‟re in pain. You can do this by hovering over a limb and selecting “Inject Morphine”. You‟ll very likely start hearing your heart beat a couple of seconds after you do this. This reflects your heart rate dropping because of the morphine. As mentioned above, this effect will fade in around 15 minutes. You can also manually check your pulse with the self-interaction menu 
 Head 
 Check pulse. Weak to normal heart rate is all right. You should be worried if a weak heart rate persists or if your heart rate becomes very weak. Epinephrine can be a solution in this case to raise your heart rate.

Soldiers can also go unconscious. Most of the time this won‟t last very long (up to 15 seconds), but you should definitely intervene if the person stays unconscious. First, get them in a safe place. You can drag or even carry them with the interaction menu  “drag” or “carry”. The most important thing to do then is stopping them from bleeding further. Bandages and tourniquets are your friend here. Use the interaction menu (Left windows key by default). Make sure you call out to your fireteam lead that someone is down/unconscious. If you‟ve dealt with his wounds and the medic hasn‟t arrived yet, you should repeatedly perform CPR on the person until the medic is there and tells you to stop or the person wakes up. You can do this by using the interaction menu on their torso 
CPR.

**Practical tips**

```
 If you get hit, try to get to cover as soon as possible and bandage yourself and possibly give yourself morphine. If there‟s no cover nearby, consider throwing a smoke grenade in front of you to break line of sight with the enemy. Always call out to your team lead if you get hit. As soon as there‟s a lull in the firefight, ask permission to get medical assistance from the medic.
 If someone goes down, either unconscious or dead, call it out to your team lead by saying/yelling “man down”. Once the medic has arrived and he doesn‟t need your help, Don‟t focus on the unconscious guy, but cover your sector instead, unless you are explicitly told to provide medical assistance to your teammate.
