# Getting started

## First time use

This section describes how you get started using CFsync if you are a first time user or if you just re-installed your setup. It happens to the best of us! :D

Assumptions:
This guide assumes that you have downloaded Arma 3 and have run the game for the first time. If that is not the case please see this [guide](#404) for installing Arma 3 and which DLC's would be recommened for the best player experience.

### Download CFsync

1. First you need to download [CFsync](https://cfsync.freedom-fighters.eu/cfsync.zip)
2. The zip contains 4 files

==cfsync-cli.exe==
This is used by the exe file to run the updater, to run the service needed for the UI
==cfsync.exe==
This runs the UI and is your main usage
==config.csm==
This is the config file that describes where the mods should be downloaded to and where to download them from
==version.csm==
This file is used to control when to update the cfsync progam.
